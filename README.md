# Barnes-Hut Simulation

The Barnes-Hut simulation is an efficient algorithm for approximating N-body problems, reducing the computational complexity from O(nÂ²) to O(n log n). This implementation, written entirely in Rust, showcases the power and performance of this approach.

## Features

- **Efficient N-body Simulation**: Utilizes the Barnes-Hut algorithm for fast approximation of gravitational interactions.
- **Rust Implementation**: Leverages Rust's performance and safety features for robust and efficient code.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Provides a real-time visual representation of the simulation.
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows users to adjust simulation parameters for different scenarios.
