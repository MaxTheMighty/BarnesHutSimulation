Canvas:
- Create color function
- Revert functions to RGB map
- Iterate over RGB spectrum without using HSV

Quadtree:
- Change to store index for body list, instead of having duplicates
- Change from Vec to Array for subtrees

Overall:
- Run the algorithm on the GPU (will require massive rewrite)
- Integrate egui support
